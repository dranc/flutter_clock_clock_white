## Demo

A live demo is [available here]( https://clockclockwhite.firebaseapp.com)

## How to use

Just launch the app and discover a beautifull clock.

If you set *demo* as the location in the setting of the clock, the clock will show minutes/seconds and will be updated every 13 seconds.

If you set *demo-XXXX* where *X* is a digit, it will display *XXXX*. For exemple, if you choose *demo-0808*, the clock will display *0808*.

## Support

The clock supports 12/24 hours display and light/dark option. The light/dark transition is not supported, the color will change when the time will update.

*Fill free to give me some feedback.*
